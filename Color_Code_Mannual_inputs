Here instead of printing minorColor[i], which means we are combining each majorColor[i] with the same minorColor[i] in each loop.
So instead of cycling through all 5 minor colors for each major color, we're repeating the same minor color 5 times.
printf("%d | %s | %s\n", i * 5 + j, majorColor[i], minorColor[i]);
